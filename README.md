A Color Guessing Game Using RGB (Written in Vanilla JavaScript)

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

Why did I create it?

  I created this project to practice my CRUD and creating RESTful routes with Node.js. I wanted to experiment with using a new css         framework too (Semantic UI) which has its advantages over bootstrap. And to have FUN!

What's it for?

  This game is meant to help me and others improve their RGB color skills. Simple, but effective.

What's cool about it?

  Very few people know their rgb values, and this game can really improve rgb knowledge. I use it all of the time for practice!


How does it help people?

  After a few games, you'll be ever the wiser and quicker at how to identify rgb values.
